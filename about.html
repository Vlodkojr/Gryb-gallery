                    Hi, my name is Volodymyr Romanovskyi and my hobby is gathering mushrooms.
                My favourite place to gather mushrooms is near town Skole in Lviv region.
                It is located in Carpathians in national park "Skolivski beskydy". I and 
                my father like to gather a several kinds of mushrooms, anong them are: 
                white mushroom, aspen mushrooms and chanterelles. They are not easy to find
                but they are the safest and the most delicious. You can find them in lawns,
                that called "ply", from August till late autumn. 
                So come to our woods and have a good luck!</pre>
